## Reporting issues

You can use the Issues section of this repository to report problems in the documentation. When submitting an issue, please indicate:

  * What page the issue occurs on; a URL or filename is best.
  * What the issue is, using as much detail as you can provide.
    * The issue might be simple. For example: "The page has a typo; the word 'complie' in the third paragraph should be 'compile'."
    * The issue might be more complex. If so, please describe it with enough detail so that it's clear to the AWS documentation team what the problem is.

## Code Examples

The code examples featured in this documentation can also be found in a separate repository: aws-doc-sdk-examples. Some examples were written for Node.js while others were written for browser script execution. The header comments at the top of each code file have additional information.

In addition to examples in JavaScript, you'll also find examples for each of the other AWS SDKs in the aws-doc-sdk-examples repository. If you find issues with any of the examples, you can submit issues or fork the aws-doc-sdk-examples repository and submit a pull request!
